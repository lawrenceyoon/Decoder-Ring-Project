# Decoder Ring Project

## Intention
This project from Thinkful's course was to test our ability to build complex algorithms in order to complete the 3 JavaScript-focused challenges. At the end, we had to write our own Mocha & Chai tests for specific edge cases. I worked on this project with 4 other members (5 total), and was a great experience to think outside the box. These were intense, focused algorithm challenges that had the flexibility to be written how we want, but had to pass certain tests. For example, if an argument that was passed in was empty (empty object or array), we had to write specific edge cases in our code to return a certain message.

## Future Goals
This project is one I'll try to come back to and rewrite using different array methods and functions, just for the practice.

## Stack
HTML, JS, NodeJS, Mocha & Chai Testing
